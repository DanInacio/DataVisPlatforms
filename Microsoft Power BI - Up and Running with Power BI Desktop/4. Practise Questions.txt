HOMEWORK: Visualizing Data with Power BI Reports
Using the Adventure Works report, complete the following:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Add a new report page named "Customer Detail" and complete the following steps:

- Add a matrix visual to show Total Orders and Total Revenue
by customer full name for the top 100 customers by revenue (top N by Revenue Filter!)

- What happens when you try to pull in Total Returns as well? Why?

- Sort the matrix by TotalRevenue (descending) to show the top revenue-generating customers
Spot check: You should see Mr. Maurice Shan as the top customer,
with $12,407.96 in Total Revenue

- Add conditional formatting to show data bars
on the TotalOrders column and a background color scale
on the Total Revenue column, and customize the style however you'd like

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Add a Donut Chart to show Total Orders by Gender (on the Legend):

- Title the chart "Orders by Gender", and adjust formatting to match
the gauge charts on the Customer Detail tab (centered, gray background, light gray font)

- Copy the chart and paste two more versions:
one to visualize orders by IncomeLevel,
and a second to visualize orders by Occupation
(remember to update the chart titles!)

- Update the report interactions so that each donut chart
(as well as the matrix) filters the other two donuts, instead of highlighting
Spot check: If you select "Mr. Maurice Shan" from the matrix visual,
you should see the charts filter to only show
Gender = M, Income Level = Average, and Occupation = Professional

- Hold CTRL to select all three donuts, and use the formatting tools
to align the top of each chart and distribute horizontally

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Add a Line & Clustered Column chart to show
TotalOrders (as columns) and TotalRevenue (as a line),
with Start of Month on the shared X-axis:

- Update the chart title to "Orders & Revenue by Month",
and format the chart style however you choose
Spot check: You should see that "Mr. Marco Lopez" drove the most orders (3) in June 2017

- Select the matrix, and update the report interaction mode
to filter the combo chart (vs. highlighting)
Spot check: You should see that "Mr. Marco Lopez" placed orders
in June 2016, August 2016, March 2017 and June 2017

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Add a Treemap visual to show Total Orders (values) grouped by Current Age:

- Update the chart title to "Orders by Age", and format the chart style however you choose

- Select the matrix, and update the report interaction mode
to filter the treemap (vs. highlighting)
Spot check: Ages will change over time since they are based on
the TODAY() function, but you should see the most orders for age 50 and 49

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Add a card to show FullName, and make the following updates:

- Turn off the Category Label, update the card title to "Top Customer",
and adjust formatting to match the donut charts

- Format with a light yellow background fill
(to match the product cards on the exec summary page)

- Add a Top N visual-level filter to show the #1 customer based on Total Revenue
Spot check: You should see "Mr Maurice Shan" when the view is unfiltered,
and "Mrs. Janet Munoz" when filtering on Female customers only

- Copy and paste to create two new cards:
one showing Total Orders, and the other showing Total Revenue,
and update card titles to "Customer Orders" and "Customer Revenue", respectively
Spot check: Among high income customers, you should see
"Mrs. Lisa Cai" as the top customer, with 7 orders and $11.33K in revenue

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Add a text box that says "Executive Summary", and insert an arrow button next to it:

- Return to the "Exec Summary" page, activate the bookmark tab,
and add a bookmark named "Exec Summary"
(View - Bookmarks Pane - Add)

- Return to the "Customer Detail" page, and link the arrow button
to the bookmark you just created using the object "Action" properties
Spot check: CTRL-click the arrow to confirm that the link works as expected  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) Make any formatting tweaks you see fit
(alignment, chart styles, separation lines, etc),
and save a (completed!) copy of the report
