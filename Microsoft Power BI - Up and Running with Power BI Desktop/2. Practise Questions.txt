HOMEWORK: Creating Table Relationships & Data Models in Power BI
Using your Adventure Works Power BI file, complete the following:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Navigate to the RELATIONSHIPS view, and perform the following actions: 
   a.) Right-click to delete each relationship between Sales, Customers and Calendar
       (including both date fields)
   b.) Use the Manage Relationships tool to delete all remaining relationships
       between all tables

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Recreate all table relationships, and confirm the following:
   a.) Cardinality is 1-to-Many for all relationships
   b.) Filters are all One-Way
   c.) Filter direction correctly flows "downstream" to data tables
   d.) Data tables are not connected directly to one another
   e.) Both data tables are connected to all valid lookup tables
   f.) Product-related tables follow a snowflake schema

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Return to the REPORT view, and complete the following:
   a.) Edit (or insert) the matrix visual to show ReturnQuantity (values)
       by CategoryName (rows) from the Product_Category table
   b.) Which category saw the highest volume of returns? How many?
          ACCESSORIES=1130
   c.) Replace CategoryName with Year from the Calendar table
   d.) How many returns do you see in 2015 vs. 2016?
          2015=86; 2016=770
   e.) Replace Year with FullName from the Customer table
   f.) What do you see, and why?
          ALL DATA REPLICATED. No relationship set between customer and returns!!!
   g.) Update the matrix to show both OrderQuantity and ReturnQuantity (values)
       by ProductKey (rows) from the Product table
   h.) What was the total OrderQuantity for Product #338?
          50

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Unhide the ProductKey field from the Returns table:
   a.) In the matrix, replace ProductKey from Product table with
       ProductKey from the Returns table
   b.) Why do we see the same repeating values for OrderQuantity?
          FOREIGN KEY is being used instead of a primary key!!!
          Flow does not go upstream!!!
   c.) Edit the relationship between Returns and Product tables
       to change the cross filter direction from Single to Both
   d.) Why does the visual now show OrderQuantity values by product,
       even though we are using ProductKey from Returns?
          FILTER NOW PASSES from Returns > Product > Sales!!!
   e.) How many orders do we see now for Product #338? What's going on here?
          PRODUCT IS NOT SHOWING UP. Product had no returns!!!
          A filter with no items from Returns > Product > Sales = BLANK!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Complete the following:
   a.) Change filter direction between Returns and Product tables back to single (one-way)
   b.) Hide the ProductKey field in the Returns table from report view
       (and any other foreign keys, if necessary)
   c.) Update the matrix to show ProductKey from the Product table,
       rather than Returns table
   d.) Recommendation: Save a separate backup copy of the .pbix file
