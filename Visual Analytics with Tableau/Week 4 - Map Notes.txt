IF YOUR COLUMN IS IDENTIFIED AS LOCATIONS

- You will get a world map generated automatically
- There are a number of geographic roles
	Area Code
	Country
	Region
	City
	ZIP Code
	Latitude/Longitude
	...
- You can customize your map view, select "Map" > "Map Layers"

- What if the data is not formatted to be recognized as a location???
	Answer: Custom Geocoding
	How? -> Click on the "Unknown" button and edit your data

- To join two maps, right-click on one of the columns and select "Dual Axis"

Note: I did not have a field with locations in my dummy test dataset,
which is why I resorted to taking notes on mapping.
