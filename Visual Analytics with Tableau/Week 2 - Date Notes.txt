IF YOUR COLUMN IS IDENTIFIED AS A DATE

- You will get a hierarchy (Year > Quarter > Month > Day), same as Power BI
- You can transform a date column from Discrete to Continuous (right-click)


Note: I did not have a field with dates in my test dataset,
but the information was on a very introductory level. Nothing really new.
